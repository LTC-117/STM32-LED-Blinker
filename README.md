# STM32-LED-Blinker
This project is designed for the STM32F103C8T6 microcontroller. It implements a simple firmware that alternately blinks the built-in LED and an external LED (connected to PC14). The project uses custom macros defined in a header file specifically for the F103C8T6, which will be updated for future projects.
(This project was made using PlatformIO, use 'pio run -t compiledb' to create the compile_commands.json).
